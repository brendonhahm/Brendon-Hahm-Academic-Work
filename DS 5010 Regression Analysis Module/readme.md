This package is part of my DS 5010 Final Project. This package contains implementations of creating linear regression using OLS implementation. This package was largely for my own interest in causal inference analysis and a desire to understand regressions outside of popular packages. While my package makes use of many statistical libraries for small purposes, I do most calculations from scratch for learning purposes. 

The purpose of the package is to fit regressions for the purpose of causal inference analysis. Features of the package include:
* hypothesis testing for significance of coefficients
* basic model information
* correlation measuring
* 2d plotting
* basic feature engineering relevant to regression fitting
* significance testing of parameter estimates
* p value estimation
* residual plotting for heteroskedasticity


The modelling_test.py uses seaborn's titanic dataset to test the functions and classes as implemented in modelling.py.
